# Cleaning Data Assignment Submissions

## Submission Artifacts  :

 - README.dm - this file
 - CodeBook.md 
 - final tidy data set final_data.txt
 - "run_analysis.R" - script used to produce the data from the project data input

 ## How to run the script :

 The project data zip file should be unzipped in a working directory. The script should
 be run in R or Rstudio with working directory configured to be this directory.

 The script will look for files like features.txt, features_info.txt, activity_labels.txt 
 in the working directory. It will aos pick up the test and train data set files from the 
 "test" and "train" subfolder under the working directory

The script will run and create a file named "final_data.txt" in the working directory
